# Practice of Singleton Design Pattern Implementation

Develop a Singleton pattern in the class com.github.diogosmendonca.MySingleton.

For practice verification, run the tests. 

```bash
mvn test
```

Check the console messages of the tests to improve your Singleton. If all tests are passing, your implementation is correct. 

The minimum Java JDK  version for testing is 11.
