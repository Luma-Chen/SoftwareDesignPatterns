# Practice of Facade Design Pattern Implementation

Make the refactoring of app code to introduce Facade pattern in the control layer (control package).
View layer is calling the BusinessObjects directly, make the calls pass through the Control Facade class.
For practice verification, run the tests. 

```bash
mvn test
```

Check the console messages of the tests to improve your Facade. If all tests are passing, your implementation is correct. 

The minimum Java JDK  version for testing is 11.
