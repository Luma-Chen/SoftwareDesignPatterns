# Practice of Factory Method Design Pattern Implementation

Make the refactoring of app code to introduce Factory Method pattern and eliminate duplicate code. In Main, AppA and AppB classes there are duplicate or very similar code. Use the classes App and Product to abstract common code and implement Factory Method pattern. Make the refactoring of the necessary code.

For practice verification, run the tests. 

```bash
mvn test
```

Check the console messages of the tests to improve your Factory Method. If all tests are passing, your implementation is correct. 

The minimum Java JDK  version for testing is 11.
